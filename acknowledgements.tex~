        \begin{block}{SaltProc}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item New tool \textbf{SaltProc} was developed to simulate fuel depletion in the \gls{MSR} core with taking into account online reprocessing.
                \item \textbf{SaltProc} was tested for \gls{MSBR} conceptial design, equilibrium fuel salt composition was found and verified against recent \gls{ORNL} studies.
		\item Average $^{232}$Th refill rate throughout 20 years of operation is approximately 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh$_e$.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Moltres}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item New tool \textbf{Moltres} was developed for modeling coupled physics in fluid-fuelled, molten salt reactors.
		\item 2D-axisymmetric and 3D multiphysics models are presented.
		\item \textbf{Moltres} demonstrated strong parallel scaling (up to 384 physical cores) on a typical model problem but further optimization required.
		\item Over 55,000 node-hours were consumed on \textbf{Blue Waters} to perform this research.
        \end{itemize}
