  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  Ordinary tools cannot capture kinetics in mobile fuels or long term fuel 
        cycle performance of liquid-fuelled reactors. 
        \begin{block}{SaltProc}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item New tool \textbf{SaltProc} was developed to simulate fuel 
                        depletion in \glspl{MSR}.
                \item \textbf{SaltProc} was tested for the \gls{MSBR} conceptial design, equilibrium fuel salt composition was found and verified against recent studies.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Moltres}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item New tool \textbf{Moltres} was developed for modeling coupled physics in novel molten salt reactors.
		\item 2D-axisymmetric and 3D multiphysics models are presented.
		\item \textbf{Moltres} demonstrated strong parallel scaling (up to 384 physical cores) but further optimization required.
		\item Over 55,000 node-hours were consumed on \textbf{Blue Waters} to perform this research.
        \end{itemize}

                 \begin{enumerate}
                 \item Improved TH capabilities in Moltres will enable more realistic precursor drift.
                \item Equilibrium state search for Transatomic \gls{MSR} (\textgreater 30,000 node-hours).
                \item Fuel cycle performance analysis for load-following regime \\ (\textgreater 40,000 node-hours).
                \item \gls{LWR} fuel transmutation in \gls{MSR} viability (\textgreater 30,000 node-hours).
		\vspace*{0.15in}
                \item Start exploring transients in Moltres, e.g. explore responses to reactivity insertion or gaseuos poison removal (\textgreater 70,000 node-hours).
