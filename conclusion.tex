  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  Ordinary tools cannot capture kinetics in mobile fuels or long term fuel 
        cycle performance of liquid-fuelled reactors. 
        \begin{block}{Moltres}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item New tool \textbf{Moltres} was developed for modeling coupled physics in novel molten salt reactors.
		\item 2D-axisymmetric and 3D multiphysics models are presented.
		\item \textbf{Moltres} demonstrated strong parallel scaling (up to 384 physical cores) but further optimization required.
		\item Over 55,000 node-hours were consumed on \textbf{Blue Waters} to perform this research.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{block}{Also: SaltProc}
                \begin{itemize}
                \item New tool \textbf{SaltProc} was developed to simulate fuel 
                        depletion in \glspl{MSR}.
                \item \textbf{SaltProc} was tested for the \gls{MSBR} conceptial design, equilibrium fuel salt composition was found and verified against recent studies.
